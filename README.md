# GHBTutorialExamples

This is a collection of turtorials I followed to learn reverse engineering and advanced tools such as Ida Pro for code disassembly.

It culminated in an internally injected dll for Counter-Strike Source which allowed me to use advanced hacking techniques such as ESP and aimbot. 

This one was a ton of fun, and taught me a lot about file organization, C++, and the absolute lowest level of memory manipulation.
